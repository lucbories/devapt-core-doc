# Devapt - Roadmap


## 2.0.x   breaking changes and new features (CURRENT)

### MAIN GOALS
When I was working on devtools features with devapt 1.0.x, I meet some trouble with missing features.
An other problem was to deal with topology definition and deployment information previously stored in many pieces of code.
It was difficult to obtain a global view of defined or deployed topology.
So I pull out deployment information from topology definition.

One missing feature for fine deployment was the lake of customer and version of defined items.



Main added features:
* isomorphic Credentials class to deal with session information on browser or on server (tenant, application, username, token...). (DONE)
* isomorphic data management classes: DataStore, DataRecord, DataCollection...
* topology management classes: TopologyDefineItem...(DONE)
* topology deployment classes: TopologyDeployLocalNode... (DONE)
* browser router (for single page application and more) (DONE)
* isomorphic cache management (DONE)
* versionned Collection to register versionned items (CURRENT)
 

Main breaking changes:
* settings json format has evolved
* module was renamed to package
* change Collection.$items from [] to {}, use lodash as collection backend



New topology tree is now:
```
world: the root of the topology

-nodes
--nodeA
---serverA1
---serverA2

-tenants
--tenantA
---applications
----applicationA
-----url
-----license
-----provided_services
-----used_services
-----used_packages
-----used_plugins
-----assets
---packages
----packageA
-----base_dir
-----resources
-----services
---security

-plugins
--pluginA
---type
---file or package

-deployments
--tenantA
---applicationA
----assets
----services

-security
-loggers
-traces
```
That's why previous roadmap is outdated, sorry for the changes.
