# Devapt - Features - Messaging

## Description
A distributed application needs to provide a communication between its nodes.

Devapt provides messages buses to ensure JSON messages exchange.

![Messaging](https://github.com/lucbories/devapt/blob/master/docs/features/buses.png)

Each topology node has 3 buses to communicate inside a node or between nodes:
* metrics bus: metrics collectors push metrics messages on this bus and metrics server listen on it to reduce metrics values.
* messages bus nodes servers and services communicate through messages.
* logs bus: each node part can log its activity on this bus.

Each browser has a socketio bus for communication between browser and topology.


Example for message communication inside a Node

Node A

Server A1			Server A2




## Status
The nodes, servers and services are ready for use.
The messaging bus is ready too but it sould be tested on many host.

To finish: push configuration.

Need Test, Optimization and code review.



## For Devapt users:
Coming soon.

### SimpleBus
AJ Lopez provides many specialized projects.
It's a great work.
One of them is SimpleBus, a messaging system between a server and its clients (local or remote).
